Operational instructor for **Flame Division Academy**.  
This repo does **not** teach theory — it verifies execution.

## 🎯 What This System Does

Flame Division Academy Tutor AI:

- Guides students through real AI system builds  
- Checks **structure, wiring, function, responsibility, and clarity**  
- Refuses vague answers and incomplete builds  
- Only certifies working, responsible systems

## 🗂 Repo Structure (V0.1)

```text
.
├── system/
│   └── tutor-core-prompt.md      # Core system instructions for the Tutor AI
└── templates/

⚠️ **Required edits before committing:**

1. Under “As the academy grows…”, add or remove bullets to match your real plan.  
2. Under “How To Use This Repo”, if you change folder names later, update the README.

### 🔁 YOUR NEXT MOVE

1. Create `system/` and `templates/` folders.  
2. Add both files with the content above, including your required custom edits.  
3. Update `README.md` as shown, with your modifications.  
4. Commit and push.

Then return with either:

- A fresh screenshot of the new file tree **and**  
- The updated `README.md` content  

for **re-evaluation**.

Until then:
